  <p>This talk traces the evolution of speaker diarization systems, from traditional multi-stage approaches to modern end-to-end architectures. I will begin with a historical overview, highlighting the shift toward end-to-end modeling and the subsequent partial return to hybrid approaches. The core of the talk focuses on loss functions designed to address key challenges in diarization: permutation invariance through the powerset loss, streaming diarization via a look-ahead loss, and the extension to joint speaker segmentation and separation using the PixIT loss.</p>

      <p>As generative AI has revolutionized the field of speech and audio generation, there is an increasing need for automatic quality assessment methods. In recent years, data-driven speech quality assessment (SQA) methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) have improved greatly, and have been used by both academic and industrial researchers to evaluate speech generation models. Nonetheless, there are still unsolved problems, and the application of such methods to other audio types remains underexplored.
        This talk will be divided in to three part. (1) I will first give an overview of SQA, with a special focus on recent developments of automatic SQA methods in the era of DNN. (2) I will talk about my experience in organizing the VoiceMOS challenge, a scientific event that aims to establish unified tasks, datasets, and evaluation processes, in order to compare different SQA approaches and shed light on insights and unsolved problems. (3) Finally, I will discuss the current challenges and future directions in the quality assessment of speech and beyond</p>

      <p>Voicebox is a non-autoregressive generative speech model based on flow-matching and is trained to perform speech infilling given audio context and the corresponding text. The Voicebox model can be used for zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis, noise removal, content editing, style conversion, and diverse sample generation. In this talk, we will first review the Voicebox model. We will then focus on the synthetic speech generation capability of the model and present several use cases of these synthetic signals in various applications including automatic speech recognition and spoken language understanding. Through a few early studies on using Voicebox generated speech signals, we will discuss the cost saving benefits of the approach in terms of speech data collection and potential shortcomings of using synthetic speech in these applications.</p>

      <p>Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) is a widely used method for automatic speech recognition (ASR), renowned for its simplicity and computational efficiency. However, it often falls short in recognition performance. In this work, we propose the Consistency-Regularized CTC (CR-CTC), which enforces consistency between two CTC distributions obtained from different augmented views of the input speech mel-spectrogram. We provide in-depth insights into its essential behaviors from three perspectives: 1) it conducts self-distillation between random pairs of sub-models that process different augmented views; 2) it learns contextual representation through masked prediction for positions within time-masked regions, especially when we increase the amount of time masking; 3) it suppresses the extremely peaky CTC distributions, thereby reducing overfitting and improving the generalization ability. Extensive experiments on LibriSpeech, Aishell-1, and GigaSpeech datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our CR-CTC. It significantly improves the CTC performance, achieving state-of-the-art results comparable to those attained by transducer or systems combining CTC and attention-based encoder-decoder (CTC/AED).</p>

      <p>This presentation explores the forefront of generative AI research for sound design at Adobe Research. I will provide an overview of Latent Diffusion Models for audio, which form the foundation of our work, and introduce several recent advancements focused on controllability and multimodality. I will begin with SILA, a technique designed to enhance the control of sound effects generated through text prompts. Following this, I will present Sketch2Sound, a model that generates sound effects conditioned on both audio recordings and text. Lastly, I will examine MultiFoley, a model capable of generating sound effects from both silent videos and text. Throughout the talk, I will showcase a series of examples and demos to illustrate the practical applications and potential of these models, making the case that we are only beginning to unveil a completely new paradigm in how to approach sound design.</p>

      <p>Deploying Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems on-device or in the cloud presents distinct challenges and opportunities. On-device models can theoretically benefit from proximity to the user's speech, enabling personalization. However, methods for achieving this without labels often yield suboptimal performance. This talk will initially present Samsung AI Center Cambridge's latest research efforts in robust unsupervised adaptation of ASR models using as little as 1 minute of unlabeled speech.
        In the cloud, the increased availability of computational resources has driven the development of large language model-powered ASR models (SpeechLLMs), which are expected to offer higher accuracy. However, and as the second part of this talk will illustrate, caution is warranted when evaluating SpeechLLMs. Indeed, ASR benchmarks for SpeechLLMs are often flawed and may suffer from test sets contamination. The pretraining phase of most LLMs involves exposure to text content that is identical to the test sets of common ASR datasets, resulting in a clearly biased evaluation and potential performance impacts.</p>

      <p>Sign languages are unwritten, low-resource languages that convey meaning through gestures of the hands, upper body, and face.  They are used by millions of deaf and hard of hearing individuals around the world, but sign language technologies are far behind those for spoken and written languages.  There has been some encouraging progress, including on tasks like isolated sign recognition and sign-to-written language translation.  However, the current state of the art is far from handling arbitrary linguistic domains and visual environments.

      <div class="collapse" id="march27">
      <div class="card card-body">
      <p>Neural audio codecs have significantly advanced audio compression by efficiently converting continuous audio signals into discrete tokens. These codecs preserve high-quality sound and enable sophisticated sound generation through generative models trained on these tokens. However, existing neural codec models are typically trained on large, undifferentiated audio datasets, neglecting the essential discrepancies between sound domains like speech, music, and environmental sound effects. This oversight complicates data modeling and poses additional challenges to the controllability of sound generation. To tackle these issues, we introduce the Source-Disentangled Neural Audio Codec (SD-Codec), a novel approach that combines audio coding and source separation. By jointly learning audio resynthesis and separation, SD-Codec explicitly assigns audio signals from different domains to distinct codebooks, sets of discrete representations. Experimental results indicate that SD-Codec not only maintains competitive resynthesis quality but also, supported by the separation results, demonstrates successful disentanglement of different sources in the latent space, thereby enhancing interpretability in audio codec and providing potential finer control over the audio generation process.</p>

      <p>Speech foundation models are transforming research by unifying speech-processing tasks through scaling data, model size, and task diversity. This shift has divided research roles, with large tech companies building foundational models and smaller entities focusing on refinement and analysis, raising concerns about explainability due to limited transparency. To address this, our group has developed Open Whisper-style Speech Models (OWSM) at Carnegie Mellon University, replicating OpenAI Whisper-style training using public data and our open-source toolkit ESPnet. Our models exhibit explainable behaviors due to their transparent development. We also investigate scaling laws and emergent capabilities in speech foundation models by studying model and data size impacts within the OWSM suite. This presentation will discuss these advancements and the research challenges they present to the speech and audio community, emphasizing open collaboration and transparency to enhance accessibility and interpretability in speech processing technologies.</p>

      <p>Singing voice synthesis (SVS) has emerged as a rapidly evolving research area. However, achieving high-quality and expressive singing synthesis remains a challenging task, requiring large-scale curated datasets, effective modeling strategies, and robust evaluation frameworks. This talk will provide a comprehensive overview of the key components of SVS research, covering data curation, model development, and evaluation methodologies. We will introduce ACE-Opencpop and ACE-KiSing, two large-scale singing voice datasets designed to support diverse SVS applications. On the modeling side, we will explore TokSing, a discrete token-based SVS approach, and SingOMD, which leverages multi-resolution discrete representations to enhance synthesis quality. In terms of evaluation, we will discuss the Interspeech 2024 Challenge on Speech Processing Using Discrete Units, the SingMOS dataset for MOS prediction, and VERSA, a versatile evaluation toolkit for speech, audio, and music processing. By bridging data, modeling, and evaluation, this talk aims to provide insights into the current advancements and challenges in SVS research, highlighting emerging directions for improving naturalness, expressiveness, and overall synthesis quality.</p>

      <p>Recent advances in single-channel speech enhancement have yielded substantial performance gains but often at the cost of prohibitive model sizes or inference complexity. In this talk, I present a three-part framework addressing these challenges by unifying speaker-agnostic compression, personalized modeling, and scalable architectures. First, we discuss speaker-agnostic model compression via low-bit quantization. Drawing on Bitwise Neural Networks (BNN) and Incremental Binarization on RNNs, we show how feedforward and recurrent networks can be quantized to binary parameters, thereby drastically reducing computational complexity with only a minor degradation in enhancement quality. We also explore discriminative hashing approaches (e.g., Boosted Locality Sensitive Hashing) to represent audio spectra as highly compact binary codes—enabling efficient lookups for source separation in resource-constrained devices. Next, we shift toward personalized speech enhancement—a speaker-aware model compression paradigm. Here, zero-shot approaches that exploit speaker embeddings or knowledge distillation serve to adapt compact models on-the-fly without requiring any clean speech data from the user. By selecting or distilling knowledge from large teacher networks, these personalized systems can adapt to new speakers or recurring noise conditions at test time, thus bridging the performance gap between large, general-purpose models and lightweight, specialized models. Finally, we introduce scalable and efficient enhancement architectures. Building on blockwise optimization (BLOOM-Net) and modified cold diffusion, we design flexible models whose internal blocks or iterative steps can be selectively engaged based on real-time resource constraints. This scalability lets the same network accommodate diverse deployment scenarios—ranging from low-power embedded devices to higher-capacity servers—while maintaining strong enhancement performance. </p>

      <p>In today's landscape of natural language processing (NLP) and speech processing, developing applications often begins with fine-tuning a foundation model. However, teaching a foundation model new skills is not as straightforward as it seems. Despite the sophistication of current models, introducing new capabilities can often impair their original functions, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. While experience replay is a common solution, the lack of open-source training data for models like LLaMA poses challenges for continuous training. This talk will delve into recent research on fine-tuning language models, including their spoken counterparts, focusing on preserving their initial capabilities. This talk will also share some benchmarks related to the ongoing fine-tuning of foundation models.</p>

      <p>State-of-the-art speech recognition systems do not work well for many languages, limiting the digital participation of many speakers worldwide. To address this challenge, we need both better ways to reliably measure speech model performance, and new algorithms for bridging this performance gap. In this talk, I propose solutions to both these problems, beginning with ML-SUPERB 2.0, a new benchmark to evaluate multilingual speech models on language identification and automatic speech recognition (ASR) across languages and datasets. Indeed, our benchmark reveals large differences in ASR performance between languages, regardless of the modeling approach used. To mitigate this, I introduce a new model training objective based on distributionally robust optimization. Our new method reduces ASR performance differences between languages by minimizing the training loss of the worst-performing language. This work paves the way for more equal access to speech technology for speakers of all languages. </p>

        <p> Neural audio codecs (NACs) have gained significant attention as essential technologies for audio compression and as foundational components for speech language models. In the era of speech LMs, there are both challenges and opportunities in the codec domain. This talk presents three topics of NACs, including modelling, evaluation and security. 
          This talk introduces TS3-Codec, a Transformer-Based Simple Streaming Single Codec. TS3-Codec provides key benefits, including streaming capability, low computational demands, low bitrate, and a single codebook design, all while delivering high audio quality. 
          Additionally, this talk presents Codec-SUPERB, the first benchmark designed to evaluate codec models in terms of reconstruction quality from both signal-level and application-level perspectives. 
          Finally, this talk presents CodecFake, the first deepfake audio dataset based on codecs. The CodecFake dataset equips models to effectively counter codec-based speech generation systems.

        <p>Discrete audio tokens have recently gained considerable attention for their potential to connect audio and language processing, enabling the creation of modern multimodal large language models. Ideal audio tokens must effectively preserve phonetic and semantic content along with paralinguistic information, speaker identity, and other details. While several types of audio tokens have been recently proposed, identifying the optimal tokenizer for various tasks is challenging due to the inconsistent evaluation settings in existing studies. To address this gap, we release the Discrete Audio and Speech Benchmark (DASB), a comprehensive leaderboard for benchmarking discrete audio tokens across a wide range of discriminative tasks, including speech recognition, speaker identification and verification, emotion recognition, keyword spotting, and intent classification, as well as generative tasks such as speech enhancement, separation, and text-to-speech. Our results show that, on average, semantic tokens outperform compression tokens across most discriminative and generative tasks. However, the performance gap between semantic tokens and standard continuous representations remains substantial, highlighting the need for further research in this field.</p>          </div>

        <p>He will discuss his recent work on generating explanations for audio models. While deep learning models excel at achieving high performance, they often function as black boxes, offering little transparency into their decision-making processes. His aim in this line of work is to develop methods that produce listenable explanations for these black-box audio models without compromising their original performance. Through several metrics, he demonstrates that the explanations generated by his approach remain faithful to the original model and are both listenable and understandable.   </p>

        <div class="card card-body">
        <p> Continual learning in end-to-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-ASR) often suffers from catastrophic forgetting, where fine-tuning leads to significant performance degradation on previously seen data. While adapters offer a way to switch between fine-tuned models, they still underperform in unseen domains—a challenge when the input domain is unknown. We propose a method that reduces forgetting to just 3.4%, significantly outperforming fine-tuning strategies like LoRA, which exhibits a 49% forgetting rate. By linearly interpolating the parameters of multiple models fine-tuned from the same generalist model, we achieve a unified model that excels across diverse datasets. Moreover, this model can be iteratively fine-tuned and averaged while maintaining low forgetting rates. Our experiments demonstrate the robustness of this approach across various datasets and models, presenting a promising solution for continual learning in E2E-ASR.</p>
